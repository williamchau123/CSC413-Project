# CSC413-Project
• Model:
– A figure/diagram of the model architecture that demonstrates understanding of the steps involved in
computing the forward pass
– Count the number of parameters in the model, and a description of where the parameters come from
– Examples of how the model performs on two actual examples from the test set: one successful and one
unsuccessful
• Data:
– Describe the source of your data
– Provide summary statistics of your data to help interpret your results (similar to in the proposal)
– Describe how you transformed the data (e.g. any data augmentation techniques)
– If appropriate to your project, describe how the train/validation/test set was split. (Note that splitting
the training/validation/test set is not always straightforward!)
• Training:
– The training curve of your final model
– A description how you tuned hyper-parameters
• Results:
– Describe the quantitative measure that you are using to evaluate your result
– Describe the quantitative and qualitative results
– A justification that your implemented method performed reasonably, given the difficulty of the problem—or
a hypothesis for why it doesn’t (this is extremely important)
• Ethical Consideration:
– Description of a use of the system that could give rise to ethical issues. Are there limitations of your
model? Your training data?
• Authors
– A description of how the work was split—i.e. who did what in this project.
