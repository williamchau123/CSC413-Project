Once I start the compose file with docker-compose up and try to open localhost:8080 I cannot access the site - I get the response ""ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE"". The log stays empty.

129,"Recently our SonarQube server was upgraded and gave us the opportunity to integrate it with GitLab, based on the configuration mentioned here:

https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/gitlab-cicd/

Now the problem we are experiencing is that the external sonar job fails the pipeline in case the quality gate is not reached.

While this is the correct and expected behavior, I was wondering whether there is any kind of configuration that will not make the entire pipeline fail, even if the the quality gate is not reached.

My concern is that we have develop against many projects some of which are quite old (legacy code) and might not always reach the quality gate defined for them. I know that what I am asking is not optimal -- i.e the quality gate should always be reached -- but given the current circumstances at my workplace there is no other alternative."
130,"I'm entering a method, and want to create a new Bing Ads API CampaignManagementService object.

var _campaignManagementService = new BingAds.ServiceClient<BingCampaignManagement.ICampaignManagementService>(authorizationData, BingAds.ApiEnvironment.Production);
This requires an AuthorizationData object.

var authorizationData = new AuthorizationData
{
    Authentication = authentication,
    DeveloperToken = developerToken,
    AccountId = accountID,
    CustomerId = customerId
};
And the authentication object for this is generally something like this:

var authentication = new OAuthDesktopMobileAuthCodeGrant(
    oAuthScope: OAuthScope.MSADS_MANAGE,
    clientId: clientId,
    environment: ApiEnvironment.Production
);
So far, so good, for the usual case.

However, generally, code samples and docs then say to do something like:

authentication.RequestAccessAndRefreshTokensAsync(refreshToken);
to populate the Authentication object with the access and refresh token data.

In my case, I know both the access and refresh tokens, and I'd like to create my service with them without having to pull them down and save them again. (I know the access token can expire, but in this case it has been generated/saved not long prior to this call. In this case we're coming in with knowledge of the tokens...but need to create a new service.)

Is there a way to create the service with the existing tokens?"
131,"I am trying to use an inherited instance of the generated BaseVisitor class to construct an AST from the parse tree of the grammar I am using for a simple compiler.

Consider a subset of my grammar where Stat is a statement of a lightweight language:

...
program: stat;

stat: SkipStat                         # Skip
    | type Ident AssignEq assignRHS    # Declare
    | assignLHS AssignEq assignRHS     # Assign

...
My understanding (as per this post) is to have the visitor call visit(ctx->stat()) where ctx has type ProgramContext*. The derived visitor then correctly makes calls to the corresponding overridden visitSkip(..), visitDeclare(..), etc.

I have simple node classes for my AST, again a subset looks as follows:

struct BaseNode {};

struct Program : BaseNode {
    Program(std::shared_ptr<Stat> body) : body(std::move(body)) {}
    std::shared_ptr<Stat> body;
};

struct Stat : BaseNode {};

struct Assign : Stat {
    Assign(std::shared_ptr<AssignLHS> lhs, std::shared_ptr<AssignRHS> rhs) :
        lhs(std::move(lhs)),
        rhs(std::move(rhs)) {}

    std::shared_ptr<AssignLHS> lhs;
    std::shared_ptr<AssignRHS> rhs;
};

struct Declare : Stat {
    Declare(std::shared_ptr<Type> type, std::string name, std::shared_ptr<AssignRHS> rhs) :
        type(std::move(type)),
        name(std::move(name)),
        rhs(std::move(rhs)) {}

    std::shared_ptr<Type> type;
    std::string name;
    std::shared_ptr<AssignRHS> rhs;
};

struct Skip : Stat {};
Tying the two points together, I am trying to have the mentioned visitSkip(..), visitDeclare(..), etc. (which are all of type std::any) to return std::shared_ptr<Skip>, std::shared_ptr<Declare>, etc. such that visitProgram(..) can receive them from a call to visit in the form

std::shared_ptr<Stat> stat = std::any_cast<std::shared_ptr<Stat>>visit(ctx->stat());
However (!), std::any only allows casts with the exact known class and not any derived class, so this approach does not work. Instead, I have started to create my own visitor entirely separate from (i.e. not a child of) the generated visitor.

I assume there is a better solution using the generated classes that I am missing.

Having found this answer to a not dissimilar post, is it even worth constructing an AST? If my idea of how to use antlr4 is inaccurate, please let me know and point me towards a good source I can start from. Thanks.

Edit: As per chapter 7 of the definitive antlr 4 reference, I believe I could achieve what I desire through the use of a stack holding BaseNode* and casting the popped nodes appropriately. This does not seem like the best solution. Ideally, I would like to achieve something similar to the java implementation method wherein we pass an expected return type into the visitor classes.

Edit 2: I have now implemented such a solution (making use of a listener instead of visitors), example below from the exitAssign(..) function:

void Listener::exitAssign(Parser::AssignContext* ctx) {
    const auto rhs = std::static_pointer_cast<AssignRHS>(m_stack.top());
    m_stack.pop();

    const auto lhs = std::static_pointer_cast<AssignLHS>(m_stack.top());
    m_stack.pop();

    m_stack.push(std::make_shared<Assign>(lhs, rhs));
}
I still feel this solution is not the best - it feels very hacky as order of arguments must be popped in reverse, and it is easy to forget to push onto the stack after creating the AST node.

I will use this implementation for now, but again, if a better method is preferred by people who use antlr 4 in c++, please do let me know."

undefined is not an object (evaluating 'u.Foo')
Currently in my code when I call XNativeModule.Foo() from my JavaScript code, React Native bridges the call to the native module by sending a message to the native side using a message queue. On the native side, the Xamarin runtime receives the message and routes it to the appropriate native module. In this case, it will call the Foo() method defined in the XNativeModule class. In Xamarin.Android, the ReactContextBaseJavaModule class is used to create a native module that can be called from the React Native JavaScript code. But it is not working for me. I have no clue how to fix this. Any suggestions?"

137,"My browser-side JavaScript uses a dynamic import import('/some-url') which sometimes throws an error.

How can I tell whether the thrown error originates from the loaded JavaScript module, or from the browser because no JavaScript module was found at '/some-url'?

The error thrown by the browser if '/some-url' doesn't return a JavaScript module doesn't seem to follow any convention:

In Chrome, err.message is 'Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://stackoverflow.com/some-url'
In firefox, err.message is 'error loading dynamically imported module'.
A hackish way to implement this:

async function isJavaScriptModule(url) {
  try {
    await import(url);
  } catch (err) {
    if (isNetworkError(err)) {
      return false;
    } else {
      // The module at `url` may throw an error when loaded.
      // It's still a JavaScript module so we return true.

  return true;
}

function isNetworkError(err) {
  const messages = [
    ""Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"",
    ""error loading dynamically imported module"",

147,"I am trying to implement the 'registration campaign' feature in the azure portal. As outlined here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign

My goal is to have users be prompted to register the Microsoft Authenticator app for passwordless sign-in. With these requirements:

On their Initial sign in (where they reset their password)
Without a manual step (like enabling a user for MFA in the portal), as I am creating users via the Graph API. Graph API calls to configure users are okay, Powershell is less desirable.
Ideally, the user is able to defer the Authenticator sign-up
Ideally, the user is not prompted to supply an MFA phone number
I have Security Defaults turned off, I have enabled Microsoft Authenticator and Email OTP authentication methods, I have enabled the registration campaign and currently I believe no forms of MFA turned on (but I had tried a few).

Working through the pre-requisites mentioned in the article I tried several configurations but was never able to get a new user prompted to register the Authenticator app. I will outline my confusion with the prerequisites:

Prerequisite 1

Your organization must have enabled Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication. Every edition of Azure AD includes Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication. No additional license is needed for a registration campaign.

It seems there are multiple ways to enable MFA, and it isn't clear which methods are appropriate.
I tried adding MFA on all sign-ins with conditional access, and it didn't seem to have an effect. Also, wouldn't doing this defeat the purpose of using the Authenticator app? and it's unclear which MFA option I should be using.
I don't think that I want MFA enabled through security defaults (again, trying to avoid using phone number) or via Identity Protection (seems to be superseded by conditional access)
There also appears to be an MFA server, but I am assuming that this is not applicable, so I have ignored it.
Is there another place to enable MFA?
Prerequisite 2

Users can't have already set up the Authenticator app for push notifications on their account.

This shouldn't be an issue as this is a new environment and I haven't registered any Authenticator apps yet.
Prerequisite 3a

Admins need to enable users for the Authenticator app using one of these policies:

MFA Registration Policy: Users will need to be enabled for Notification through mobile app.
I believe this is referring to the Multifactor authentication registration policy in Identity Protection, but I enabled it and it didn't seem to have an effect.
Perhaps this is referring to something else?
Prerequisite 3b

Authentication Methods Policy: Users will need to be enabled for the Authenticator app and the Authentication mode set to Any or Push. If the policy is set to Passwordless, the user won't be eligible for the nudge. For more information about how to set the Authentication mode, see Enable passwordless sign-in with Microsoft Authenticator.
I have enabled the 'Microsoft Authenticator' Authentication Method Policy with 'Any' mode, but I am unsure if it is in effect.
According to the azure portal I may require 'combined registration' be turned on: 'If your tenant doesn’t yet use combined security info registration, turn it on now – it’s required to use this policy.' Following the documentation, I am unable to figure out where and how I can see if this feature is enabled or not. This document appears like it should tell me but it does not: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-registration-mfa-sspr-combined
Perhaps 'combined registration' being the new default means it's always on? and that authentication methods should be working? but then why would it present that message?
What does it mean by 'Users will need to be enabled...'? The whole point of this feature is to have the user enable the authenticator app when they sign in right?
Perhaps there is a guide somewhere to set this up? I've only found instructions beginning at the point where the prerequisites have been met."

I can confirm, that webpack is able to build the project, even with the diagnositc error from the LSP-server. So it seems to be a tsserver issue.

Here's what I've tried so far:

I've confirmed that the package exists in the github repository and that I have access to it.
I've tried cleaning the Yarn cache and reinstalling the dependencies, but that didn't fix the issue.
I've checked the .yarnrc file and confirmed that there are no conflicts with other dependencies.
I'm using Yarn 2 as a monorepo with zero install and PnP active.
I've also tried adding the repository URL to the resolutions field in package.json, but that didn't help either.
I'm using typescript in both project.
I found the added repo in .yarn/cache/... as .zip files
Is there a way to add a github repository to a Yarn monorepo with zero install and PnP active? Any suggestions on what else I could try to resolve this issue?

I have a routine that essentially calls Article().from_segments(segments) where segments is injected from another service in a loop that creates a new Article instance on every new iteration.

As you may have noticed, Loop._groups must be properly handled in order to not have its values shared among different Article instances. My (hacky) solution works fine if we call Loop.from_segments for all iterations, but this is not guaranteed as the topics segment loop may be missing in the injected segments.

This means that for an Article without the topics segments, it'll actually use the values from the previous iteration (because Loop._groups won't be cleared since Loop.from_segments won't be called).

I can think in a way to fix this by clearing Loop._groups at Article.__init__...

class SegmentGroup(metaclass=SegmentGroupMetaClass):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        for loop_label in self.__loops__.values():

If I move the PHAssetChangeRequest() line out of the requestContentEditingInput() function and directly into PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges({}) then it works, but the issue is that iOS displays a separate permission alert to allow saving the edited photo for every single photo the user selected (i.e. they have to tap ""Allow"" 10 times in a row). Instead, I only want to show a single permission alert asking ""Do you want to allow this app to modify 10 photos?"". This is definitely possible as apps like Pixelmator Photo do exactly this. How is it done?"
156,"Using python Faust, all of my logs are doubled.

As loggers are hierarchal, i want to prevent the downstream logger father.son from logging anything and propagate all the logs to upstream father logger.

I tried:

1 - setting disable_existing_loggers to True in the dictConfig when main is called

2 - adding filter (inside a handler) to a specific logger name using the dictConfig:

class LogPreventingFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        return False

logging_config = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': True,
    'filters': {
        'log_preventing_filter': {
            '()': LogPreventingFilter
        }
    },
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'filters': ['log_preventing_filter']
        }
    },
    'loggers': {
        'father.son': {
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'handlers': ['console']
        }
    }
}

dictConfig(logging_config)
3 - adding the same logging_config to faust's app configurations logging_config (with and without 'disable_existing_loggers': True) - in that case i could see logs from the logger i mentioned (father.son) but not from the father, even after i added the father logger to to faust config), nor logs from any other non-hierarichial logger ( like getLogger(""some_name_not_related_to_father"")).

ill mention that i tried to remove the filter and handler and it didnt make any change.

Worth to mention that the logs start to double only after i call faust's app.main().

also worth mentioning that the loggers that i want to actually log data are all from imported modules, not part of the code that is visible for faust. only father.son logger is.

157,"I am working on a custom QGraphicsItem that has two anchor points, and I want to be able to rotate the item around these anchors when the user interacts with them. I have implemented a mousePressEvent and mouseMoveEvent to detect which anchor the user clicked on, set the rotation anchor point, and compute the angle of rotation.

Here is a simplified version of my code:

void MyView::mousePressEvent(QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent *event) {
    _tapPoint = event->pos();

    auto cp1 = _anchor1.center(); // get center point of anchor 1
    auto cp2 = _anchor2.center(); // get center point of anchor 2

    // Anchor 1 clicked
    if (_anchor1.contains(_tapPoint)) {
        setTransformOriginPoint(cp2.x(), cp2.y()); // set rotation anchor to anchor 2
        _viewState = ANCHOR1;
    }
    // Anchor 2 clicked
    else if (_anchor2.contains(_tapPoint)) {
        setTransformOriginPoint(cp1.x(), cp1.y()); // set rotation anchor to anchor 1
        _viewState = ANCHOR2;
    }
    // View clicked
    else {
        QGraphicsItem::mousePressEvent(event);
        _viewState = VIEW;
    }
}

void MyView::mouseMoveEvent(QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent *event) {
    auto p = event->pos();

    switch (_viewState) {
        case ANCHOR1: {
            // calculate the angle of the rotation based on the mouse touch
            auto angle = qRadiansToDegrees(qAtan2(p.y() - _anchor2.y(), _width));
            setRotation(rotation() - angle); // rotate the item around anchor 2
            break;
        }
        case ANCHOR2: {
            // calculate the angle of the rotation based on the mouse touch
            auto angle = qRadiansToDegrees(qAtan2(p.y() - _anchor1.y(), _width));
            setRotation(rotation() + angle); // rotate the item around anchor 1
            break;
        }
        default:
            QGraphicsItem::mouseMoveEvent(event); // move the item normally
    }
}
However, when I try to rotate the item from one anchor point (around the other) and then rotate it again from the other anchor point, it jumps back to the initial position! I am not sure why this is happening.

As you can see in this video, when I first rotate the view it works, but when I try to rotate it from the other anchor, its position jumps to another position!"
158,"in my company we are using microservices but till now we were not following microservice principles. so in architect review we have been told to replace the same.

so we have one service called CommonService. so any request comes by client hits this service. this request hit the database and create the record and then forward the request to ManagementService. Management Service access the same DB and table and update the record created by CommonService.(Here Common and Management Both API hitting the same table in database.) same we have for other 2 services.

Common-->DB(Common_MGMT)--Management-->DB(Common_MGMT)
Common-->DB(Common_Sales)--Sales-->DB(Common_Sales)
Common-->DB--HR-->DB 
so Common_MGMT table hit by first 2 service, Common_Sales table hit by Common and Sales API . same for third. A particular customer will access only one service where it is Management , Sales or HR but he will come through commonservice. enter image description here

Now We have to follow microservice principle and due to management reasons we can not follow Database as a service and also we dont have option to redesign from scratch.

so we have thought to introduce one DBservice which will hit the database. so it is like when new request will come to Commonservice then it will access DBservice through REST and DB service will create record in database. then Management Service will access DBservice and DBService will update the same record in database. likewise for sales service and HR service.

Now still I am using same table in Database but this time only DBservice accessing. AM I following the microservice principle here?

Here which approach will be better Private table per service or Schema as a service? or both will work and I can use either of them?

There will be huge latency in this approach, can the solution be improved?

If DBService will fail then it will be single point of failure? can we do something other than creating multiple instances?

Overall can you suggest the solution for original problem? Is the solution we are proposing correct or is there better option?

Any other suggestion most welcome."

160,"I have a MediaStreamTrack that's streaming a video from the user's camera onto a <video> tag in Google Meets.

Running as a chrome extension, I'd like to replace it with a track that's just a static image.

I've tried to change the enabled flag as specified in other questions ( which turns it black instead of freezing the image ), calling stop() which kills it, or using ImageCapture.TakePhoto(...) to generate an image, put it in a canvas, and capture the canvas source - this failed because the canvas stream didn't match the original one, resulting in a black image. I tried to override other properties using Object.defineProperty() to replace the track with another after calling removeTrack(), didnt work either.

Question:
How would you go about ""freezing"" mediaStreamTrack so it contains, gets sent and recorded as just a static image?

(editor's note:
This part is from a comment on a (now deleted) Answer. It clarifies the Askers expected results)

Can you show me an example of how you'd get the source for the canvas from that (webcam) video before changing the stream for the output video into that canvas stream?

Here's the code that I used:

var vid = getVideoElementFromPage();
var Stream = vid.captureStream();
var Track = Stream.getVideoTracks()[0];
var URLIdea = undefined;
new ImageCapture(Track).takePhoto().then((imCpt) => {
    URLIdea = URL.createObjectURL(imCpt);
    // Here, I've tried setting this URL to a canvas, capturing stream and changing the track,
    // or changing the video src to the URL directly. 
    // in both cases - black screen

Although I am directly including the System.Numerics.Vectors package it is not used directly by the VSIX but is instead a reference of System.Memory, unsure if that should matter.

I also notice that for other package references that are found, the last line in the fusion log is it looking in the extension folder, so why isn't it looking there for Numerics.Vectors?"

curl -i http://KUBENODE_2_IP:MY_PORT/echo -H 'Host: kong.example
everything works fine, just as I expected. But if I replace KUBENODE_2_IP with KUBENODE_1_IP, the call results in a timeout. (Ingress controller pod runs on that node as well.) Does anybody know what else shall I configure to make it working?

Both boxes have the MY_PORT opened on them.

I am having hard time understanding use of evaluator = EmbeddingSimilarityEvaluator.from_input_examples(dev_samples, name='sts-dev') . The documentation says that evaluator – An evaluator (sentence_transformers.evaluation) evaluates the model performance during training on held-out dev data. It is used to determine the best model that is saved to disc. But in this case, as we are fine tuning on our own examples, train_dataloaderhas train_samples which has our model sentences and scores. How is train_samples different than dev_samples?

Also if the model is going to print performance against dev_samples then how is it going to help to determine the best model that is saved to disc.? Are we required to run dev_samples against the model saved on the disc and then compare scores?

If my goal is to take a single model and then fine tune it, is it okay to skip parameters evaluator and evaluation_steps?

also how to determine total steps in the model? i need to set evaluation_steps"

176,"I have an app that calls an API to get the username and password of a certain service (Azure Function). I created the Azure API & Azure Function in order to hide the credentials in the html/javascript code (the web app). The credentials are coming out of the Azure Function via Json and are sent to my web app via the API. However, the issue with this solution is that POSTMAN is still able to access my API and as a result display the credentials (something any respected developer would be able to do)

I tried the following so far with no avail:

Have a CORS setting that allows only one website to access my API. See setting below.
Restrict my Azure Function to allow only the IP address of the API Management service. This does not work bec the postman can merely call the api.
In both cases nothing works. Any help?

I would like to understand from a ggplot object itself the order in which the transformations have been applied.

We can access the layers, scales etc using p1$layers, p1$scales etc, and we can find them there in order of appliance by transformation type, but I need to know the order overall.

$layers elements are equivalent between the plots above (as can be checked with waldo::compare(p1$layers, p2$layers), $scales element however differ due to environments found as attributes, function enclosures, or elements of other environments. This is the part I got stuck at.

A general answer is best, but an answer that will work ""90% of the time"" would be appreciated too. The general issue is not only about scales and layers but should include other transformations as well (coordinates, position, themes) as long as their position relative to objects of other types changes the output.

The output for the given examples might look like :

# 1st scale than 1st layer then 2nd layer
gg_order(p1)
#> scales layers layers 
#>      1      1      2

# 1st layer than 1st scale then 2nd layer
gg_order(p2)
#> layers scales layers 
#>      1      1      2

# 1st layer than 2nd layer then 1st scale
gg_order(p3)
#> layers layers scales 
#>      1      2      1

179,"I have a web app made with ASP.NET (constrained to .NET 4.5) using the WebApi which has a controller class.
In this controller, I had to make two new endpoints who have to call another service which is instead a Java application using Spring Web, but that might be besides the point.
The problem here is that, one of these two endpoints needs to simply forward Server-Sent-Events sent by the spring application.

I have no idea how to do this in c#. These are the two things I've tried so far but obviously they didn't work:

            return await client.SendAsync(request, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead);
        }
    }

    {
        log.Error(""[myEndpoint] Error"", ex);
        return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);
    }

}
I wish there was a way to simply forward the input of the http call I need to make to the output of my response...

What I actually need to do: the Spring application needs to stream text as it completes a certain operation. I need to read that text in real time to show something on the user's screen as that operation is going on.
I know that I could make an asynchronous operation that stores its state somewhere and make a call like every second to fetch the progress, but I really wanted to try doing it this way instead."

181,"I am new to Kafka and PySpark+Structured Streaming and we have a requirement to stream data from a Kafka topic and ingest into another table while data undergoes multiple transformations. I understood the concept of checkpoint, its uses and advantages. But one thing thats confusing me is what is the right place to use it? ReadStream or WriteStream?

For example, I am reading like this:

def read_from_kafka(spark: SparkSession, kafka_config: dict, topic_name: str, column_schema: str, checkpoint_location: str):
    stream_df = spark.readStream.format('kafka') \
        .option('kafka.bootstrap.servers', kafka_config['broker']) \
        .option('subscribe', topic_name) \
        .option('kafka.security.protocol', kafka_config['security_protocol']) \
        .option('kafka.sasl.mechanism', kafka_config['sasl_mechanism']) \
        .option('kafka.sasl.jaas.config', jass_config) \
        .option('kafka.sasl.login.callback.handler.class', kafka_config['sasl_login_callback_handler_class']) \
        .option('startingOffsets', 'earliest') \
        .option(""maxOffsetsPerTrigger"", kafka_config['max_offsets_per_trigger']) \
        .option('checkpointLocation', checkpoint_location) \
        .load() \
        .select(from_json(col('value').cast('string'), schema).alias(""json_dta"")).selectExpr('json_dta.*')
    return stream_df

stream_df = read_from_kafka(spark, config, topic_name, schema, checkpoint_location)
And writing the same df into some location as below.

def write_data(spark: SparkSession, kafka_df: DataFrame, checkpoint_location: str):
    kafka_df.writeStream \
        .format('kafka') \
        .foreachBatch(some_func) \
        .option('checkpointLocation', checkpoint_location) \
        .start()
        .awaitTermination()

def some_fun(kafka_df: DataFrame, batch_id: int):
    kafka_df.write.parquet(s'some_path_{batch_id}')
My confusion is do I need checkpoint at both Read & Write streams? I see some documentation where checkpoint is used only at WriteStream() If I only use it in WriteStream() and don't use it at ReadStream() how can Kafka+SparkStream know from which offset of the topic should the read resume? Will there be any impact if I use it in both ReadStream() and WriteStream()?

Can anyone let me know the what is the right place to use checkpoint when reading and writing data from a Kafka topic?"
182,"When consuming, Spark can use consumer group offset stored in Kafka itself, therefore checkpoints aren't required.

Checkpoints store state of the actions you've performed, rather than only Kafka offsets.

If it's not negatively affecting your application, then checkpoint both."

UPD: The example of the object in the collection (I've included only related to this query fields) start_date is stored as Date in mongoDB:

{ CurrentState: { start_date: 2022-01-01T00:00:00.000+00:00 }}
Field start_date is not presented in the schema (it is created with a strict: false option). But I've tried to add this field to the schema with type Date and I've got the same result.

197,"I would like to replace a class at the assembly level so all references call a new implementation. Lets say I have common class used in assemblies throughout my project such as

System.Generic.Collections.List

My project references other assemblies who rely on List as well.

Now lets say I want to use my version of List Where ever this is called.

var values = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
How can replace a class on the assembly level so I don't have to update any references in my code or so that it can be done in a single location.

I remember there are metadata buddy classes and things like that is it possible to override using a global pragma? I vaguely remember using syntax like this for something: System.Generic.Collections.List::MyAssembly.List

I would like to replace this in a duck-typed way where the underly class doesn't nessecarily have to inherit from the original but I should have all the methods exposed in the same manner

Note: I need to resolve this in a global manner, a single entry point via reflection or configuration.

I've already done things in the past to dynamically replace methods, see: Dynamically Append Code to a method .Net-Core"
198,"I have two branches in my remote repository.

master has a file in a folder myFolder/myFile.
my-branch has a pushed commit that renamed myFolder/myFile (camelCase) to myfolder/myFile (flatcase).
I have cloned it into two local repositories in my case-preserving MacOS environment, set ignorecase = true in the .git/config file, and checked out those two branches

When I switch between those two branches with the first local repository, the folder is updated correctly with the correct case, either myFolder or myfolder. This local repository is freshly cloned.
But somehow, when I switch between the two branches with the second local repository, the folder's case is not updated, it stays the same. This local repository is older and has seen some git operations done prior to this.
How can I find out why those two local repositories behave differently? They both have the exact same .git/config file

How can I fix the second repository so that the folder case gets correctly updated upon switching branch?"

200,"I'm new to traefik and k3s, I imagined it to be mature so I can install it easily without problems. But I struggle with it. I installed k3s with traefik and from what I've read/googled so far, after adding service+deployment+ingress, it should just work. but it does not :frowning: I must be missing something basic, hope you can point me to the problem or link some tutorial/docs I missed.

So after installing k3s with traefik (default), there is this deployment version: rancher/mirrored-library-traefik:2.9.4.

I have a Django REST Framework serializer which uses select_for_update in combination with atomic transitions, like this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/querysets/#select-for-update/. That works fine, except that I want to write something to the database when an error is thrown... and these insert statements are getting rolled back, never making it to the database.

The code is something like this (very much simplified but gets the point across and is reproducible):

models.py
from django.db import models


class LicenseCode(models.Model):
    code = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=True)


class Activation(models.Model):
    license_code = models.TextField(max_length=200)
    activation_log = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    success = models.BooleanField(default=False)
views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse, Http404
from django.db import transaction
from .models import Activation, LicenseCode

class LicenseRedeemSerializer:
    @transaction.atomic
    def save(self):
        license_codes = LicenseCode.objects.all().select_for_update()

        activations = []

        for license_code in license_codes:
            activations.append(
                Activation(license_code=license_code.code, success=False)
            )

        self.activate_licenses(activations)

    def activate_licenses(self, activations):
        try:
            # In our real app we'd try to activate the licenses with an external SDK. This can fail.
            raise Exception(""Something went wrong!"")

        except Exception as e:
            for activation in activations:
                activation.activation_log = str(e)
                activation.save()

            # With our real DRF serializer we'd raise ValidationError
            raise Http404(""Could not activate the license!"")


def view(request):
    # Let's make sure we have a license code to work with
    LicenseCode.objects.get_or_create(code=""A"")

    serialier = LicenseRedeemSerializer()
    serialier.save()

    html = ""Hello there""
    return HttpResponse(html)
The problem I am facing is that when the external SDK triggers an error and I'm trying to write something to the database, that this never ends up in the database, the transaction is just rolled back.

How can I make sure that I can still write something to the database when using atomic transactions, in the except block?"
202,"My program should select three cameras and take pictures with each of it.

203,"I have a website where members can acquire certifications through training and their certificates contain QR code for verification. How can someone verify that when they scan the QR code in the certificate, they will know that the certificate is valid and that it belongs to the person presenting it?

Let's say a member can access the website through his phone. He presented one of his certificates to a verifier and the verifier scans the QR code to check if the certificate is valid and the owner is the true owner. Upon scanning, the verifier is directed to the website with a url with some code like https://website?verify=34932hasdkd63243ndk. Since the QR code is generated on the fly, the code contains the hash of the certificate and timestamp at the time the QR code is generated. In the backend, I'll unhash the code, check if the timestamp is generated within 30 minutes, and check if the certificate id exists in the db. Is this approach enough or correct? I am new in QR code and there could be better ways to make sure that the one showing the certificate with QR code is really the owner of the certificate and not just someone who happened to get a screenshot of the certificate and presented it as his. Also should I make sure that the verifier is logged in to the website or anyone outside of the organization can verify the QR code?

204,"This seems like a pretty standard problem, but it's just so simple I don't know what to do about it. From what I've read elsewhere on SO, this is caused by Generics when ArrayLists are initialized without specifying parameters. I also know that the warning does not come up when I comment out ArrayList<Integer> p = (ArrayList<Integer>)is.readObject();, so I'm pretty sure there is a generics safety issue with the compiler by me trying to cast the Object to an ArrayList<Integer>. How can I save the ArrayList without causing this?

Here's the code:

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class FileTest
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String fileName = ""fred.txt"";

        a.add(2);
        a.add(3);
        a.add(4);
        try
        {
            ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(fileName));
            os.writeObject(a);
            os.close();
        }
        catch(FileNotFoundException e){e.printStackTrace();}
        catch(IOException e){e.printStackTrace();}
        try
        {
            ObjectInputStream is = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(fileName));
            ArrayList<Integer> p = (ArrayList<Integer>)is.readObject();
            //for(int i : p) System.out.println(i);
        }
        catch(FileNotFoundException e){e.printStackTrace();}
        catch(IOException e){e.printStackTrace();}
        catch(ClassNotFoundException e){e.printStackTrace();}
    }
}"
205,"I have a list of lists in java.

static ArrayList<List> permutationS = new ArrayList<List>();
The inner list is an ArrayList of integers.

List<Integer> innerList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
Now I want to select an innerList, If it contains a particular integer. How can I achieve this?"
206,"I am trying to understand if it makes sense to take the content of a list and append it to another list.

I have the first list created through a loop function, that will get specific lines out of a file and will save them in a list.

Then a second list is used to save these lines, and start a new cycle over another file.

My idea was to get the list once that the for cycle is done, dump it into the second list, then start a new cycle, dump the content of the first list again into the second but appending it, so the second list will be the sum of all the smaller list files created in my loop. The list has to be appended only if certain conditions met.

It looks like something similar to this:

# This is done for each log in my directory, i have a loop running
for logs in mydir:

    for line in mylog:
        #...if the conditions are met
        list1.append(line)

    for item in list1:
        if ""string"" in item: #if somewhere in the list1 i have a match for a string
            list2.append(list1) # append every line in list1 to list2
            del list1 [:] # delete the content of the list1
            break
        else:
            del list1 [:] # delete the list content and start all over
Does this makes sense or should I go for a different route?

I need something efficient that would not take up too many cycles, since the list of logs is long and each text file is pretty big; so I thought that the lists would fit the purpose."
207,"How do I concatenate two lists in Python?

Example:

listone = [1, 2, 3]
listtwo = [4, 5, 6]

>>> joinedlist

208,"If I have an object implementing the Map interface in Java and I wish to iterate over every pair contained within it, what is the most efficient way of going through the map?

Will the ordering of elements depend on the specific map implementation that I have for the interface?"
209,"Old, but my same ol' ""Got here by Google"" response.

If you want to avoid it and aren't really taxed with CPU or RAM limitations, you can try Collections.copy"
210,"Well the compiler IS correct - who says that the object you're reading in really is an ArrayList? I could easily replace the file with something completely different and you'd get an exception.

Object obj = ois.readObject();
if (obj instanceof ArrayList) 
    // do something
else 
    // Error
should work. And yes you'll still get a warning because of the generic, but then that's Java's generic system, getting rid of that would mean creating a new object and adding one Event at a time - well but then we'd have to cast Objects to Events and.. argh, no not better, just live with the generic warning."
211,"I'm getting a ""Type safety: Unchecked cast from Object to ArrayList"" warning on the line with readObject(), in this code snippet:

// Read the Event List
theEventArrayList = new ArrayList<Event>();        
String FILENAME = ""EventData.dat"";
FileInputStream fis;
try {
   fis = openFileInput(FILENAME);
   ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);
   theEventArrayList = (ArrayList<Event>) ois.readObject(); 
   fis.close();
}
Event is a simple class comprised of some Strings, Calendars, booleans, and ints. The ArrayList is written using an ObjectOutputStream in a mirror image operation to the above. The application this code is used in is executed many times a day for over a month with no failures, but the compiler warning bothers me and I don't want to just suppress it if it can be ""checked"" properly"
212,"Eclipse is giving me a warning of the following form:

Type safety: Unchecked cast from Object to HashMap

This is from a call to an API that I have no control over which returns Object:

HashMap<String, String> getItems(javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session) {
  HashMap<String, String> theHash = (HashMap<String, String>)session.getAttribute(""attributeKey"");
  return theHash;
}

223,"TL;DR: What kind of KRB5 AS-REQ ticket requests would a home-brew Kerberos client create when asked to use AltSecurityIdentities certificate fields for ticket requests?

But why?

I have a set of custom Java classes that knows how to extract a UPN from the SAN in a certificate and request a ticket from a KDC using that certificate material.

Historically, this results in a cname/principal of some simple strings representing the ""login.name"" and a realm. With these two pieces of information an AS-REQ to a Windows Server KDC initiates getting a ticket and handles the pre-auth using the account and key details associated with the correct user in the AD tree.

With some sites moving away from UPN principals and adopting AltSecurityIdentities I'm looking at augmenting how we do this for sites where UPNs are deprecated. (In this case, ""deprecated"" means that UPNs will not be used to map to AD users, and in some cases SANs on tokens may not have UPNs present.)

The problem I'm running into is that there is a lot of info about configuring AltSecurityIdentities on the server or enabling (say) Subject and Issuer mapping for some or all users. But it isn't clear to me how to provide this information to the KDC so it can find the user in the AD tree and go down the path of pre-auth, etc. There isn't a lot of information on how KRB5 clients would explicitly use any AltSecurityIdentities strings they build from certificates when requesting tickets from a Windows KDC.

Plainly put, is the ""X509:<I>IssuerName<S>SubjectName"" String expected to be used such that it would show up (say, in a Wireshark capture) as the ""cname-string"" now?

If I were to sniff the network traffic between the KRB5 client and the KDC, what might the AS-REQ req-body look like?

(I cheerfully admit I don't really understand the semi-recent KB articles suggesting ""explicit"" mappings to accounts as a workaround for some broken behaviour, and if this affects me or not. Perhaps cert-based mappings require implicit mappings?)

At the end of the day, none of the generic RFCs or Microsoft whitepapers shows what the cname might be for an example explicit mapping."

To test this, I wanted to see how a true lover of immutability like Clojure handles it. Unfortunately, I'm an ignorant C# programmer who speaks neither Java nor Clojure so my Googles have been unhelpful.

In C#, we have a distinction between value types and reference types. This is just the classic ""pass-by-value"" and ""pass-by-reference"" distinction.

238,"I raised a question a week or two back about the syntax for sending emails using the standard Laravel mail conventions, specifically including cc/bcc recipients.

My assumption was that my code was incorrect and for this reason whenever I tried to email with cc/bcc recipients it didn't work. When I say it didn't work, I mean that ""to"" recipients received the email, but nobody specified as a ""cc"" / ""bcc"" recipient did.

However, having tried all the code samples given in that post and having undertaken further testing it seems that this assumption was incorrect.

By more testing, I mean that I've now made simple test pages of PHP that use the default PHP mail() function. Using these, the cc/bcc recipients DO work.

So this suggests something in the Laravel setup must be at fault. However it isn't something fundamental such as my mail config because sending to normal recipients that are not cc/bcc works reliability with no issue.

I've also varied my test cc/bcc recipients quite a lot and the mails never arrive for any of them. So this isn't specific to a certain email platform or receiving server that is rejecting them.

So what could be wrong here? Any ideas?

What options do I have to enable verbose logging to the mail mechanisms in Laravel (v9) ?

Example code for sending to cc/bcc recipients:

$options = [
    'cc' => 'cc@test.com',
    'bcc' => ['bcc1@test.com', 'bcc2@test.com'],

The instance in the queue are of class A:

    username: z.string().min(1),

241,"I'm building an installer/downloader that detects the architecture and downloads the version of the main executable compiled with that architecture. If it doesn't exist yet, it'll be compiled on the server on the fly.

I can easily get the CPU name, e.g. ""Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10900KF CPU @ 3.70GHz"", but how do I convert this to the correct string for the -march and -mtune settings for MinGW?

I cannot rely on any dependencies, it need to be able to determine this using a standalone script or executable that can be run by the installer to determine the correct string. Or I could use a massive list of all CPU names converted to -march strings, but where would I find that?

EDIT: I cannot use -march=native because the compiler is not on the client machine. What I'm doing is detecting the architecture on the client machine by an installer, then compiling for their architecture on the server. So I cannot use -march=native."
242,"I'm using selenium to access a page that requires logging in. Currently I'm doing something like this:

driver = Chrome()
driver.get('https://www.example.com/')

driver.get('https://www.example.com/user-data')
# do stuff
json.dump(driver.get_cookies(), open(cookies_path, 'w'))
driver.quit()
The script is scheduled to run every hour. However, it can only run successfully 23 times. At the 24th time, when driver.get('https://www.example.com/user-data') is executed, the driver will be redirected to the login page and my code breaks. Then I have to manually log in again, manually save the cookies, but the new cookies will still be invalid after 24 hours. But on my own laptop, I can stay logged in on this website indefinitely and have never been redirected to log in. I tried skipping expired ones when adding cookies to the driver, but it did not help.

FYI the website is using OAuth2 and I guess my cookies expire when the session token expires on the server. Is there a way to keep the cookies valid indefinitely with selenium like with my browser?

The way this works is that the user clicks on the menu 'Reminders' then the reminders page is open and on the reminder there is button 'Show notifications' that open up the drawer. What i want is just to click on the menu 'Reminders' and then the drawer is opened up.

244,"A while ago I created my github pages website with react app. I can still access it fine when I go to the url - it shows it up to date with whatever styling or things I added. but when I clone the repo to my computer and try see what files/code there is, I'm not seeing any of the typescript code related to the website. There are a few commits but they were from when I first created the app. Like there is the App.tsx file but in that is just the bare bones of whats usually given when you create the react app

245,"I am considering using Citus because my app is text-book multitenancy app and my problems are exactly what Citus is meant to solve (some tenants are starting to grow so big that they are starting to affect other tenants processes). Schema-wise I'd need some changes but not too much. My biggest issue is that currently we are using AWS RDS and Citus is only offered as a SAAS solution in Azure. Migrating to Azure is not an option. I could potentially move to a self-hosted Postgres cluster, but there are two big downsides to that:

I'd have to build out a lot of things that come ""for free"" with RDS. Stuff like backups, observability, etc...
We are very very limited on DBA resources and self-hosting our own cluster obviously needs more of that.
So I was thinking:

Would it be possible to use RDS nodes as Citus worker nodes and only self-host the coordinator/master node? So i would get most of the RDS ""for free"" stuff (critical data is backed up etc) and still get to use Citus. It seems possible at first glance, because it feels like that worker nodes are not even aware that they are Citus nodes. Or is there something I'm missing? Has any of you done that? Are there any huge downsides to that compared to fully self-hosting? Do I get worst of both and best of neither or would it actually make sense considering doing it like that?"

RV - RecyclerView, VH - ViewHolder

GOAL: Vertical RV with VH containing dynamic number of vertical views, lets say the number of views ranges from 1 to 10.

IMPLEMENTAION: Put inside VH of outer RV inner vertical RV and submit new list to inner RV adapter inside of onBindViewHolder() of outer RV.

PROBLEM: Lag on scroll of outer RV caused by inflation of VHs for inner RV. It's because RV creates VHs on demand as user scrolls and when scroll happens VH for outer RV created which in turn triggers inflation of VHs for inner RV and its the main cause of lag. The culprit is the inflation for sure because lag occurs only on first scroll of 5-7 VHs and it's gone, which means rebinding is lightweight task."

383,"I am trying to run a plugin called burp-jenkins-integration from my Jenkinsfile.

Unfortunately, the plugin authors do not officially support running this plugin from a Jenkinsfile, they only support running it as its own freestyle job.

However, I did some digging inside the plugin and found the constructor I want to use (it's called SiteDrivenScanRecorder) and what parameters it takes. For example, the sample Jenkinsfile below works perfectly:

import org.jenkinsci.plugins.burpscan.SiteDrivenScanRecorder
timestamps {
    node () {
        stage ('Burp') {
            def site_driven_scan_recoder_url = new SiteDrivenScanRecorder('https://myburp.blah/', 'SecretAPIKey', '', 'MySite', 'medium', 'tentative', '0', '120', '', '', 'summary').getEnterpriseServerUrl()
            print(""EnterpriseServerUrl:"")
            print(site_driven_scan_recoder_url)
        }
    }
}
However, in order to actually run the plugin, I need to run a weird perform() method found inside the SiteDrivenScanRecorder class. The method's signature is the following:

public boolean perform(hudson.model.AbstractBuild<?, ?>, hudson.Launcher, hudson.model.BuildListener) throws java.io.IOException, java.lang.InterruptedException;
How could I run this method? In particular, I don't know what objects I should pass in the 3 parameters and how I can get them.

I understand it might not be possible to do this (and I can always create a freestyle job which I will call from my Jenkinsfile if it's not), but it doesn't hurt to ask."

386,"I want users of my Next.js TypeScript app to grant it permission to manage their Alexa Lists.

I figured this would be possible with OAuth2.

I figured I'd need to create a button in my website that takes the user to an Amazon URL that allows the user to grant my website permission to manage their Alexa lists (and then generates a code that it includes in a GET request that happens as a redirect to a ""callback"" URL that I registered as the redirect_uri when setting up OAuth2 in Amazon).

I figured the button would be a link to a URL defined like

const url = `${oauth2BaseUrl}?client_id=${encodeURIComponent(clientId)}&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirectUrl)}&response_type=code&scope=${scope}`;
This is generally how OAuth2 works, in my experience.

But I've found Amazon's docs incredibly unhelpful.

I see permissions / scopes mentioned here called alexa::household:lists:read alexa::household:lists:write.

I've set up my API endpoint (which I'll specify at redirectUrl) to exchange the Amazon authorization code for an Amazon access token following the code examples shown there.

I've set oauth2BaseUrl to be 'https://www.amazon.com/ap/oa' (found at https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html).

For client ID, I'm using the one for my Alexa skill that I created. Is that correct?

I'm using Next-auth, but I'd be curious if there are any other libraries that could make any of this easier.

Here are permissions I've added in my Skill:

                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type ""NullSafeMutableLiveData"":
   This check ensures that LiveData values are not null when explicitly       
            declared as non-nullable.

                   Kotlin interoperability does not support enforcing explicit
   null-safety when using                 generic Java type parameters. Since
   LiveData is a Java class its value can always                 be null even
   when its type is explicitly declared as non-nullable. This can lead        
           to runtime exceptions from reading a null LiveData value that is
   assumed to be                 non-nullable.

390,"When I read the original TF paper, I was told that

Dataflow simplifies distributed execution, because it makes communication between subcomputations explicit. It enables the same TensorFlow program to be deployed to a cluster of GPUs for training, a cluster of TPUs for serving, and a cellphone for mobile inference. Each operation resides on a particular device, such as a CPU or GPU in a particular task. A device is responsible for executing a kernel for each operation assigned to it. (...) The TensorFlow runtime places operations on devices, subject to implicit or explicit constraints in the graph. The placement algorithm computes a feasible set of devices for each operation, calculates the sets of operations that must be colocated, and selects a satisfying device for each colocation group.

I had never need more than one device. But now large models are all the rage, and a lot of competition is about just getting the weights of a pretrained model and run them for inference. So I want cluster all the GPUs of a room so they could be useful for this to just run a LLM, it could be an ad-hoc graph, a keras model or a HuggingFace transformer.

So, how is it done? I guess one still needs to configure a cluster description and, if such option is available still in 2.x, launch an script in each machine to join them into a cluster. And then somehow launch a master script in some other machine that loads the model, deploys its graph across the cluster, and runs it.

What I hope is to find a recipe such as: What I was looking for was a recipe such as:

Load or build the model.

From the model, obtain the graph.

For each node, launch a server for all the devices it manages, or allows allocation.

For the graph,

loop manually across, using tf.device() or something similar to
allocate each operation to a device.
or, alternatively, give to tf a list of all the target devices and let it to allocate as it needs.
execute inference."

394,"I am building a Shiny app that displays two tables side by side: a control table and a preview table. The control table displays the column names of the preview table, and the user can manipulate them by dragging and dropping columns to change their order. The user can also edit the names of the columns in the control table, and the changes are reflected in the preview table. However, I am having trouble synchronizing the columns' order between the control table and the preview table.

For a very long time, I was able to do git operations without git asking for credentials for every single command when I run things in command line.

But these days it always ask for credentials in command line!

I have tried various combinations for changing git config credentials.helper (changing to store/wincred/manager/cache) and a bunch of other things, nothing works.

Funny thing is, if I run git command inside VSCode terminal, then it will not ask for credentials and just work. But I do not want to have to fire up VSCode every time I need to do some git stuffs (especially when my computer is running low on RAM due to other tasks)

I need a permanent way to fix this issue while still using HTTPS remote url + personal access token

I'm dynamically importing components like below:

const app = new Vue({

...
When loading the page i can see that each component gets loaded when inspecting the network tab, the vendo.js file also gets loaded and it's 5MB where that shouldn't be the case when i dynamically import each component, so i should eliminate the dead code which is not getting used somehow.

The script is scheduled to run every hour. However, it can only run successfully 23 times. At the 24th time, when driver.get('https://www.example.com/user-data') is executed, the driver will be redirected to the login page and my code breaks. Then I have to manually log in again, manually save the cookies, but the new cookies will still be invalid after 24 hours. But on my own laptop, I can stay logged in on this website indefinitely and have never been redirected to log in. I tried skipping expired ones when adding cookies to the driver, but it did not help.

FYI the website is using OAuth2 and I guess my cookies expire when the session token expires on the server. Is there a way to keep the cookies valid indefinitely with selenium like with my browser?

Just saw this person had the same problem as mine, but no answer so far.

410,"I have 10 ubuntu servers running on aws as ec2 instance and a list of arguments which I need to run in each server. Outputs are saved to a PSQL database.

The arguments is a list of 1000 items which looks like this.

args 

arg1
arg2
arg3
..
..
arg1000
I split up the list into 10 parts evenly, so each server runs 100 arguments to cut down time.

So server1 opens up a file that has the following list, server2 would have args 101-200, etc.

args 

arg1
arg2
arg3
..
..
arg100
server1 opens up a function like this,

import pandas as pd
from my_functions import my_function, save_return_value_sql_db

df = pd.read_csv(arguments_file.csv)

for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    return_value = my_function(row[0])
    save_return_value_sql_db(return_value)

It saves the output value in a PSQL table called return_values.

The arguments take a different amount of time. Sometimes 3 of the servers take an hour longer than the other 7. So there is an imbalance among the arguments even though each server takes 100 arguments.

So I want to make a change to this.

I want to create a central argument_list in separate PSQL table called states and as the ubuntu servers go though the list (sharing the same list), they will change a flag in another column and move on to the next row or argument.

I am worried that multiple servers hit up the same row or argument and run the argument command at the same time on multiple servers. Is there a way around this so that no argument is run more than once by any of the 10 servers.

What I have so far is this, I created an sql table with 2 columns that looks like this,

args     state

arg1     0
arg2     0
arg3     0
..
..
arg1000  0
The servers run this python script,

import sqlalchemy
from my_engines import STATE_ENGINE
from my_functions import my_function, save_return_value_sql_db

arg_list = STATE_ENGINE.execute(f""SELECT * FROM states WHERE state = 0 order by args asc"").fetchall()

current_arg = arg_list[0][0]

STATE_ENGINE.execute(f""UPDATE states SET state = 1 WHERE args = '{current_arg}'"")

return_value = my_function(current_arg)
save_return_value_sql_db(return_value)
How do I modify this code so that the 10 servers don't run any of the args more than once or crash because the state has been set to 1 and is unable to set it to 1 because another server is trying to do the same thing?

Is there another data structure or library I can use to achieve what I am trying to do that would make things easier? I have no idea where to start. I googled a little and I saw something called rabbitmq and zeromq but I have no idea how they work or if they’re right for this."

420,I´m using CFFI for generating a DLL from python source code. It works well but it depends of python3x.dll and need some .pyd files. Is it possible to package all dependencies inside the dll or a static library ?
421,"Usually, to use the AfuEfiX64.efi BIOS upgrader from AMI, you have to run the .efi file through the UEFI shell. This works with secure boot disabled, but the UEFI shell is not accessible when secure boot is enabled, so I have to run this EFI file through a boot entry instead by dynamically creating a boot entry with efibootmgr, like so:

# this creates the boot entry with the correct parameters to upgrade the BIOS
efibootmgr -C --disk /dev/nvme0n1 --part 1 --label ""BiosUpgrader"" --loader ""\EFI\AfuEfix64Signed.efi"" --unicode ""fs:0/EFI/BIOS_UPDATE_FILE.BIN  /p /b /n /x /k /RLC:F""
# and then make sure it boots next time we restart
efibootmgr -n 000X # (X=number of created boot entry)
This works and creates the boot entry which I can run as if I start the boot loader for an operating system. When I try to boot into this created boot entry from the BIOS firmware interface, even with secure boot disabled, the screen goes dark for a second and then goes back to the firmware interface.

I believe this might happen because maybe the EFI application needs to be run inside of a UEFI shell? To fix this, I created my own EFI application that opens an EFI shell which then calls a .nsh script that runs the AfuEfiX64.efi program with the correct parameters:

#include <Guid/FileInfo.h>
#include <Library/FileHandleLib.h>
#include <Library/PcdLib.h>
#include <Library/ShellLib.h>

UefiMain(IN EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle, IN EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *SystemTable) {
  // Get the loaded image protocol for the current image
  EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL *LoadedImage;
  EFI_STATUS Status = gBS->HandleProtocol(
      ImageHandle, &gEfiLoadedImageProtocolGuid, (VOID **)&LoadedImage);
  if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
    Print(L""Failed to get loaded image protocol: %r\n"", Status);
    gBS->Stall(1000000);
    return Status;
  }

  // initialize the shell
  Status = ShellInitialize();
  if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
    Print(L""Failed to initialize the shell: %r\n"", Status);
    gBS->Stall(1000000);
    // return Status;
  }

  // Check whether the UEFI Shell protocol is present
  Status = gBS->LocateProtocol(&gEfiShellProtocolGuid, NULL,
                               (VOID **)&gEfiShellProtocol);
  if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
    Print(L""The UEFI Shell is not installed on this system: %r\n"", Status);
    gBS->Stall(1000000);
    // return Status;
  }

  // The UEFI Shell is installed on this system, run the script
  ShellExecute(ImageHandle, L""bios-update.nsh"", FALSE, NULL, &Status);
  if (EFI_ERROR(Status)) {
    Print(L""Failed to run script: %r\n"", Status);
    // wait 5 seconds
    gBS->Stall(5000000);
    return Status;
  }

  return EFI_SUCCESS;

This doesn't seem to work:

I'm getting the error ""The UEFI Shell is not installed on this system: Not found""
When proceeding, the ShellExecute function returns ""Failed to run script: Not found"", no matter what I put into the L""<command>"" parameter
If I try to execute the above EFI application through the UEFI shell, nothing happens and it doesn't output anything.
So here are my questions:

Is there a better way to directly run the AfuEfiX64.efi program, without creating my own EFI file to wrap it inside of a UEFI shell?
Is there a way to get more verbose information for why the EFI program fails to run as a boot entry?
Is it even possible to use ShellExecute when booting from a boot entry (instead of through the UEFI shell)? Or is there something wrong with my script?"

However, the windows containers still randomly run into this issue after a deployment most of the time. But have not seen this happening, when pods are scaling, due to load, based on horozontal pod autoscaler settings. In rollover restarts, the CrashLoopBackOff occurs rarely running the Windows containers with one of the above mentioned socket exceptions.

Tried adding below code fixes to increase retries and delays between retries in the apps

    return configurationBuilder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
                {
                    options
                        .Connect(appConfigurationEndpoint)

                            clientOptions.Retry.Delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
                            clientOptions.Retry.MaxDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(40);
                            clientOptions.Retry.MaxRetries = 5;
                            clientOptions.Retry.Mode = RetryMode.Exponential;
                        });
SecretClientOptions secrteClientOptions = new()
                    {
                        Retry =
                        {
                            Delay= TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
                            MaxDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(40),
                            MaxRetries = 5,
                            Mode = RetryMode.Exponential
                            }
                    };
But these retry delay etc. changes in app only resulted in, such failing container to take long time like 20 minutes to run into CrashLoopBackOff. Without above retry settings, such container (pod) runs into CrashLoopBackOff sooner with one of above socket exceptions. Sometimes when such a pod is left alone for longer time like 45 minutes to one hour it automatically manages to get up and running on the restart attempts by Kubernetes.

Any thoughts or ideas to apply as a fix for AKS or to the .NET app is helpful here as this CrashLoopBackOff is annoying. Now, what is being done is after a deployment, I check the AKS workloads, pods from Azure portal(or using kubectl) and kill the pod in crashloopback, which creates another pod by Kubernetes and that is running fine."

This is how you test the RouteUrl type:

type Url = RouteUrl<'/courses/:courseId/classes/:classId', { courseId: '123'; classId: '456' }>;

But for some reason, typescript is giving me error for Params[Param] used in RouteUrl type.

    return url;

export type Replace<
  Str extends string,
  Search extends string,
  Replacement extends string
> = Str extends `${infer Prefix}${Search}${infer Suffix}` ? `${Prefix}${Replacement}${Suffix}` : Str;
But I don't know, how we can iterate over keys of a type or an interface, that's why I can't write an alternate type for RouteUrl."

434,"TL;DR: What kind of KRB5 AS-REQ ticket requests would a home-brew Kerberos client create when asked to use AltSecurityIdentities certificate fields for ticket requests?

But why?

I have a set of custom Java classes that knows how to extract a UPN from the SAN in a certificate and request a ticket from a KDC using that certificate material.

Historically, this results in a cname/principal of some simple strings representing the ""login.name"" and a realm. With these two pieces of information an AS-REQ to a Windows Server KDC initiates getting a ticket and handles the pre-auth using the account and key details associated with the correct user in the AD tree.

With some sites moving away from UPN principals and adopting AltSecurityIdentities I'm looking at augmenting how we do this for sites where UPNs are deprecated. (In this case, ""deprecated"" means that UPNs will not be used to map to AD users, and in some cases SANs on tokens may not have UPNs present.)

The problem I'm running into is that there is a lot of info about configuring AltSecurityIdentities on the server or enabling (say) Subject and Issuer mapping for some or all users. But it isn't clear to me how to provide this information to the KDC so it can find the user in the AD tree and go down the path of pre-auth, etc. There isn't a lot of information on how KRB5 clients would explicitly use any AltSecurityIdentities strings they build from certificates when requesting tickets from a Windows KDC.

Plainly put, is the ""X509:<I>IssuerName<S>SubjectName"" String expected to be used such that it would show up (say, in a Wireshark capture) as the ""cname-string"" now?

If I were to sniff the network traffic between the KRB5 client and the KDC, what might the AS-REQ req-body look like?

(I cheerfully admit I don't really understand the semi-recent KB articles suggesting ""explicit"" mappings to accounts as a workaround for some broken behaviour, and if this affects me or not. Perhaps cert-based mappings require implicit mappings?)

At the end of the day, none of the generic RFCs or Microsoft whitepapers shows what the cname might be for an example explicit mapping."
435,"I'm executing a SELECT query on a table in MySQL using the command-line interface (not a GUI client):

SELECT * FROM blog_entry;

One of blog_entry's fields is of type 'longtext' and is such a long piece of text that when the result is displayed in my terminal the display of rows takes more than one line. This causes an ugly mess of a display, where columns aren't easily visible. What technique can I use in my SELECT query that would limit the number of characters displayed for each field so that the printed row results don't overflow to new lines?"
436,"I have an SVG object which uses d3-zoom for zoom and pan functionality. It works flawlessly but the problem showed up when I started to work on integration tests using Cypress.js.

I tried using standard mouse events on the svg element, to simulate drag behavior:

cy.get('svg')
  .trigger('mousedown', { which: 1, force: true })
  .trigger('mousemove', { position: 'left' })
  .trigger('mouseup', { position: 'left', force: true });
The example above is taken from the Cypress drag and drop recipe, and it produces the following error in the nodrag.js file:

cannot read property document of undefined

Below you can see where the error occurs (view is undefined):

__webpack_exports__[""default""] = (function(view) {
  var root = view.document.documentElement,
  ...
I spent a lot of hours trying to trigger the event in another way, but without a success - like trying the snippet above with the svg container.

Please keep in mind that I cannot access any d3.js package from the Cypress test because it's imported as an NPM package in a React application.

437,"I've registered and configured my domain's name servers to use cloudflare.

I've configured a bunch of web apps on ""Server A"" to run through a cloudflare tunnel. Everything works beautifully, and I can access my apps on subdomain.domain.whatever without problems.

445,"It looks like the difference in titles is due to the fact that iOS 16 introduced a new privacy feature that requires apps to display a more specific title when requesting access to the camera.

To customize the camera access message in your app, you need to add a description to the app's Info.plist file. The message will then be displayed on the system prompt when the app requests access to the camera.

To add a description, follow these steps:

In Xcode, open the Info.plist file for your app.
Right-click on an empty area and select ""Add Row"".
In the new row, select ""Privacy - Camera Usage Description"" from the drop-down list.
In the ""Value"" column, enter a message that describes why your app needs access to the camera.
For example, you could enter ""To take photos for your profile picture"" as the description. This message will then be displayed on the camera access prompt when the user is asked for permission to access the camera.

Once you have added the description to the Info.plist file, the camera access message should display the customized message instead of the generic one."

We were thinking that it would pass and that it was just water that had been sitting in the tank, but unfortunately the smell has persisted. Any ideas why our great tasting well water would now smell like this and what to do? It was an incredibly expensive well as they had to dig really deep and then hydro frack.

We have no plumbing in. It’s a well with a pump to the water tank which is housed in our dried in house foundation. We have a potable water drinking hose off the pipe right now. We are doing plumbing this week so the system is very simple right now. As stated, water was always great until recently. Coming out of winter here in VT, but it started before the snow thawed.

In this challenge, given a CSV file as a string, you'll return the data contained as a 2d array of strings.

Spec:

The input consists of one or more records, delimited with \r\n (CRLF), \n (line feed), or some other reasonable newline sequence of your choice
A record consists of one or more fields, delimited with , (commas), ; (semicolons), \t (tabs), or some other reasonable delimiter of your choice. You may assume each record contains the same number of fields
A field can either be quoted or un-quoted. An un-quoted field will not contain a field delimiter, newline sequence, or quote character, but may otherwise be an arbitrary non-empty string (within reason; you can assume things like invalid UTF-8, null characters, or unpaired surrogates won't appear if doing so is justifiable)
A quoted string will be delimited on both sides by a quote character, which will be "" (double quotes), ' (single quotes), ` (backticks), or some other reasonable delimiter of your choice. This character will be escaped within the string by being repeated twice (the string unquoted a""bc would be represented as ""a""""bc""). Quoted strings may contain field delimiters, newline sequences, escaped quote characters, and any other sequences of characters which may appear in an unquoted field. Quoted strings will always be non-empty
You may choose to ignore the first record (as if it is a header record)
Output:

You may represent a 2d array in any reasonable format (excluding CSV or any of it's variants for obvious reasons).

I implemented the following code to retrieve medication names from a given text (prescription_text in the code). It works by matching words in the text with a list of existing medications (US_DRUGS in the code).

You then add some flour, stir and fry some more. You then add milk, a stock cube and seasoning, stir well, bring to a gentle simmer, cover and stir occasionally until the chicken is cooked through.

Will the utensil become sterile under these conditions or is there a risk of contamination from the raw chicken?
Is there a difference in risk factor between utensil materials e.g. steel, silicone or wood?

Taken from the book: Marvin Minsky 1967 – Computation:
Finite and Infinite Machines, chapter 14.

Background
As the Gödel proved, it is possible to encode with a unique positive integer not just any string
but any list structure, with any level of nesting.

Procedure of encoding G(x)
 is defined inductively:

If x
 is a number, G(x)=2x
If x
 is a list [n0,n1,n2,n3,…]
, G(x)=3G(n0)⋅5G(n1)⋅7G(n2)⋅11G(n3)⋅...

Bases are consecutive primes.
Examples:
[0] → 3

[[0]] → 33=
 27

[1, 2, 3] → 321⋅522⋅723=
 32427005625

[[0, 1], 1] → 3320⋅521⋅521=
 15206669692833942727992099815471532675

Task
Create a program that encoding (in this way) any given (possibly ragged) list to integer number.
This is code-golf, so the shortest code in bytes wins.

Input
Valid non-empty list. You may assume:

There are no empty sublists
Structure is not broken (all parentheses are paired)
List contains only non-negative integers
Output
Positive integer obtained by the specified algorithm

Note
Numbers can be very large, be careful! Your code must be correct in principle, but it is acceptable that it cannot print some number. However, all test cases are checked for TIO with Mathematica program and work correctly.

Test cases
[0,0,0,0,0] → 15015
[1, 1, 1] → 11025
[[1], [1]] → 38443359375

473,"I am very new to electronics and working with Arduinos, I am learning a lot and would appreciate any help.

I am making a heating pad system for a high-altitude weather balloon science experiment. The circuit (sorry for the hand-drawn circuit diagram) is shown below. It is two Sparkfun heating pads powered by 4 9V batteries controlled with a MOSFET and an Arduino Uno.

Currently, the heating pad circuit works without the MOSFET, but I want to be able to control the heating pads with the Arduino using the MOSFET.

What I intend to happen

MOSFET receives 5V from Arduino and turns on the heating pads. At some point the Arduino pin is set to LOW and the heating pads should turn off and cool down.
Problems

MOSFET is overheating (the slightest touch will burn me and it melts any wire that brushes up against it) and damaging the MOSFET, causing the switch function to stop working.
The MOSFET starts heating up when the switch for the heating pads is turned on.
A new MOSFET works as intended, but over time it acts less and less reliable.
The MOSFET is exposed to open air and is not touching anything.
My assumptions

I am assuming that I am doing something wrong that is causing the MOSFET to get hotter than it is designed for, this damages the MOSFET causing it to stop working properly
Troubleshooting and tests

Heating pads draw up to 1A of current
Replace this type of MOSFET three times, tried different types of MOSFETs, similar results
Replaced and tested batteries several times, similar results
Current Code that is relevant

Declare with: pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
Turn on with: digitalWrite(11,HIGH);
Turn off with: digitalWrite(11,LOW);

477,"This is a cross-post from Math.SE. The question was asked there 3 months ago but didn't receive much attention aside from one comment asking for clarification. I feel like it might be non-trivial and so I decided to repost the question here.

Let f:(a,b)→R
 be differentiable on (a,b)
 such that f′
 has no local extrema on (a,b)
. Is it true that f′
 is necessarily monotone on (a,b)
?

If f′
 is assumed to be continuous on (a,b)
 then this is definitely true. Indeed, by continuity of f′
 each segment [x1,x2]⊂(a,b)
 contains points of global maximum and minimum of f′
 on this segment which must be attained at the endpoints of the segment (otherwise f′
 will have a local extremum), so min{f′(x1),f′(x2)}≤f′(x)≤max{f′(x1),f′(x2)}
 for any points x1<x<x2
 in (a,b)
, and the latter property can be shown to be equivalent to monotonicity.

However, derivatives can be discontinuous, and I'm not sure how to proceed in that case. I couldn't find similar problems on both Math.SE and MO or elsewhere on the internet, but the question seems so natural that it probably had been considered and researched by some analysts of 20th century."

480,"A common plot point throughout the kinds of fantasy literature that inspire D&D settings can be described as a central character growing beyond themselves, reaching a previously unknown peak of power or ability in a climactic emotionally-invested moment. As this is a somewhat obtuse description, here are a few examples (I realize that some of these may be debatable, but I'm just trying to illustrate the point).

In Tolkein's Return of the King (Lord of the Rings)...

At the end of Jordan's (and Sanderson's) Memory of Light (Wheel of Time)...

At the end of Sanderson's Oathbringer (Stormlight Archive)...

At the end of Hardy's Master of the Five Magics...

At the end of Erikson's Reaper's Gale (Malazan Book of the Fallen)...

In Rothfuss's The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicles)...

There are many many other examples of this literary device in the fantasy canon, but this list is hopefully sufficient to clarify what I'm referring to. I am assuming this device is a good literary device and so should any answer; I'm invested in the fact that many D&D players enjoy this device and would like to see it reflected in their characters' stories.

As far as I know, there are no mechanics in the rules for a character facing a climactic moment to achieve something extraordinary, and my intuition is that any rule in this space would need to be heavily DM-dependent. I've been toying with a simple approach:

At any time, a player may tell the DM that their character is attempting to perform an extraordinary feat; the feat should refer to a specific ability that their character does not yet have access to or one that they have access to but for which they do not currently have the required resources. For example, in a battle with undead enemies that is going very poorly, a level 1 Cleric might attempt to use the level-2 ability Turn Undead.
The DM chooses the appropriate attribute and sets a skill DC for this attempt; typically, this should be a hard check and should be much harder if the character is reaching for something more than 1 or 2 levels beyond their current skill level. A recommended DC might be something like 16 + twice the number of levels the character needs in order to have access to the feat. Simultaneously, the DC should be lower if the character is highly emotionally invested and higher if not. This would ultimately be up to the DM; though guidelines for how to set this would be useful (intuitively, the Cleric's Divine Intervention feature might be a good starting point).
The player rolls, and, if successful, the character manages to carry off the feat, gaining 1 level of exhaustion in the process. If unsuccessful, the character wastes their turn attempting the feat.
A character with any levels of exhaustion would be unable to attempt an extraordinary feat.
I am looking for good subjective experiences using a mechanic like this—does it work and why or why not? Are there balance issues I'm not seeing or are there ways to do this within the rules that I've missed? Additionally, I would like advice on setting the skill DC for such a check (while accepting that some amount of DM fiat will need to be involved). For the record, I'm most interested in discovering how to do this without breaking the game for my players rather than just whether my specific homebrew proposal will break the game, so alternative rules (within the limits of good-subjective) are welcome."
481,"I am aware of the different ways animals excrete excess nitrogen (mainly ammonium, urea, uric acid). My question is: why do we excrete excess nitrogen instead of recycling it? How can we explain that there has been no selection for more nitrogen recycling in animals, as this would probably constitue a selective advantage?

I have read here that ""In the quest for sufficient food energy to meet caloric requirements, animals ingest more nitrogen, largely as amino acids, than they require. Accordingly, the excess nitrogen ingested must be excreted in some form."". This is exemplified by this paper: a low protein diet comes with lower urea levels."
482,"So, for example, I am doing a song, 'Tere Hawale', Right. I transpose to my comfortable scale, so which would be E Major, right. So I find the chords, and I can have a open + Barre Chord Combination, which is, E Major Open, G#Major(Barre), AMajor, B Major(barre) and so on. Now, E and A Major are open. But the other ones are Barre, they don't have open forms(G# and B). So now I can play like this only, or an octave higher playing the open chords as Barre, meaning E Major as on 4th Fret a D Major Shape (Barre), A major on the 5th fret as a E Major shape, F# Minor as on 5th Fret in a D Minor shape. Now my question is, which of the above-mentioned ways I should play? Or rather when I should play either of the ways, what is the difference? Because Open Chords do not exist for sharp chords, F sharp and G sharp and so on."

So I'm sending files to and API, using Flutter Dio, and I keep getting error 406.

Turns out, I found out if I add the following line, it works:

To work, both lines must be on the code.

Funny thing, using the same API on Postman, and over there it doesn't require this line, so I guess this might be Flutter Dio encoding the file somehow, requiring the x-tar Content-Type for the file.

var dio = Dio();
var formData = FormData.fromMap({

499,"The splitlines() and split() methods are string methods, which means they can only be used on string objects, not file objects. That's why you are getting the AttributeError when you try to call these methods on the file object returned by open().

To load the contents of the text file into a list of lines, you can use the readlines() method of the file object, like this:

makefile
Copy code
f = open('goodlines.txt')
mylist = f.readlines()
f.close()  # Remember to close the file after reading its contents
The readlines() method reads all the lines of the text file and returns them as a list of strings. Each element of the list corresponds to a line in the text file.

Note that you should always close the file object after you are done using it to release system resources and prevent data corruption. In the example code above, the close() method is called to close the file object after reading its contents into the mylist variable."
